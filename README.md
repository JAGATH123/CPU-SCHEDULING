# CPU Scheduling Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a CPU scheduling project that explores various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin (RR).


## Overview

CPU scheduling is a critical aspect of operating systems that determines the order in which processes are executed on the CPU. This project aims to study and implement various CPU scheduling algorithms and provide a framework for simulating their behavior.

## Scheduling Algorithms

The project includes implementations of the following scheduling algorithms:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)

I also have  uploaded a Project Report.
